Microsoft doesn't automatically notify you when a zone is down. But you can use [Azure Service Health](/azure/service-health/overview) to understand the overall health of the service, including any zone failures, and you can set up [Service Health alerts](/azure/service-health/resource-health-alert-arm-template-guide) to notify you of problems.

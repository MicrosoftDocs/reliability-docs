However, some VM types and sizes are only available in specific regions, or specific zones within a region. To check which regions and zones support the VM types that you need, use the following resources:

- To check the VM types available in each region, see [Products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/).

- To check the supported VM types and sizes within each zone of a specific region, see [Check VM SKU availability](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/create-cli-availability-zone#check-vm-sku-availability).
